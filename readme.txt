Simple maintenance mode  – redirect all visitors (except admins) to a page of your choosing. 


== Description ==

Unlike other "maintenance mode" plugins, this plugin lets you redirect visitors to one of your existing pages (no need to edit a maintenance template to make it look like your website).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Maintenance redirect screen to configure the plugin
